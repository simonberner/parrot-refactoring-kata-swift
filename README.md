# Parrot Refactoring Kata

- Taken from [here](https://github.com/emilybache/Parrot-Refactoring-Kata)
- Faster unit tests by [not running the app startup logic](https://blog.eidinger.info/faster-unit-tests-by-not-running-the-app-startup-logic)
- [Shortcuts](https://swiftsenpai.com/xcode/xcode-unit-test-shortcuts/) for Unit Testing

## Learnings

- While refactoring, your code can get temporarly a little bit worse, but as long as you know where are you going and the tests are passing, than it is ok.
- Commit after each small refactoring step when Tests are passing and the design of the code gets a bit better.
- Create new stuff and use it or use it first and then go create it is an individual choice we can make.
- Does oversimplification (see Parrot protocol) lead to duplication in subclasses?
